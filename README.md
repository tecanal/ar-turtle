# ar-turtle
Implementation of Turtle Programming in JavaScript with Augmented Reality.

The goal of this project was to display Turtle programming and display it on top of a live webcam feed for an Augmented Reality
type of experience.

This is not completely done, it still needs to display the cursor dead center on load and have tutorials or levels or some way
for the user to know what to do.

Also it should have a way to switch between cameras of the device if there are multiple.
